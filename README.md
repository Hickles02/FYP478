# FYP478 - Data Reconciliation & Gross Error Detection
This is the repository for my Final Year Project. This read me file explains how to navigate through the repository to find the required code.

1. main_system   == **Model of binary distillation column**
- simulate_ODEs  >> Function that solves the ODEs of the model
- intermediaries >> Function that solves all the intermediary variables
- measureReal    >> See description below to understand why it is used in main_system

2. linearDR_01   == Redundancy analysis
