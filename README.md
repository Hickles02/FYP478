# FYP478 - Data Reconciliation & Gross Error Detection
This is the repository for my Final Year Project. This read me file explains how to navigate through the repository to find the required code.

***1. main_system   == Model of binary distillation column***
- simulate_ODEs  >> Function that solves the ODEs of the model
- intermediaries >> Function that solves all the intermediary variables of the model
- measureReal    >> 'Measures' the data generated by the model

***2. linearDR_01   == Redundancy analysis***
- measureReal    >> 'Measures' the data generated by the model
- generateLB_svm >> Perforns linear DR for given measurements
- varianceMatrix >> Generates the variance matrix
-
